Suggested demo procedures.
- Connect to the broker.
- Subscribe to 'test/echo' to see the broker echo your commands that you have sent.
- Subscribe to 'test/timestamp' to receive the epoch timestamp of the broker every 10 seconds.
- Publish to 'test/command' using either 'alert' or 'clear' as the payload.
- Contact AlertTech for further information.
