I have also created a JSFiddle @:
http://jsfiddle.net/rickyvaughn2/2m4mb7np/

Suggested demo procedures.
1. Connect to the broker.
2. Subscribe to 'test/echo' to see the broker echo your commands that you have sent.
3. Subscribe to 'test/timestamp' to receive the epoch timestamp of the broker every 10 seconds.
4. Publish to 'test/command' using either 'alert' or 'clear' as the payload.
5. Contact AlertTech for further information.
